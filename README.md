# ImperialWay
An automation script, to improve Quality of Life in the online MMORPG game, Imperia Online.

You can use, modify the script as you want. This is free for all, dont sell it.

## Supported Functionalities:
* Vassal Taxes collection
* Cave of Conquest Attacks
* Telegram Notifications

## Requirement:
* Script uses Selenium and telegram modules
* The script is written for Firefox browser, so you need to have it installed, as well as geckodriver
* need to have a telegram bot to recieve messages, can be made for free using Botfather. 
* need your telegram Chat ID, can be found using IDBot.

The script is in it's early development phase. After satisfying all the requirement you will hagve to put this script on a server and put it as a cronjob for every 30 minutes.

I will create a bash script for completing the requirement, as well as setting the script up as a cron job. But for now you can reach me on discord if you need help to deploy it.

Thanks!
